# Report and Questions about the Slides, Linear RE

Firstly, I try my best and find two typos.

But I am afraid that the rest part may be not rigorous.

1. There emphasizes $Q_1\Pi\eta_t=\phi Q_2 \Pi \eta_t$, why there must exist linear relation between the two terms?
2. next, the necessary and sufficient condition can only cause the existence of $\phi$, not including the uniqueness.

3. the dimension of $\phi$ is not clear, as I demonstrate below.
4. Is the "Premultiplying" operation called 左乘? I am afraid that I have no idea about how this operation applied to (2), and obtain such formula.
